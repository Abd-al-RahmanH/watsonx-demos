A vulnerability in the IPSec VPN feature of Zyxel ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.37 Patch 1, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.37 Patch 1, USG FLEX 50(W) series firmware versions 4.16 through 5.37 Patch 1, and USG20(W)-VPN series firmware versions 4.16 through 5.37 Patch 1 could allow an attacker to achieve unauthorized remote code execution. The vulnerability is due to a format string vulnerability in a function of the IPSec VPN feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of specially crafted payloads containing an invalid pointer. However, such an attack would require detailed knowledge of an affected deviceâ€™s memory layout and configuration.

The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.1, with a base severity of HIGH and an exploitability score of 2.2. The impact score is 5.9, indicating that the vulnerability could have a significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.

The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2023-6764 and has been published on February 20, 2024. Zyxel has released a security advisory for this vulnerability, and users are advised to update their firmware to the latest version to mitigate the risk.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-134, indicating that it is a format string vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the use of a user-supplied format string in a call to a vulnerable function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data into the format string, potentially leading to remote code execution.

Overall, this vulnerability highlights the importance of secure coding practices and the need for robust input validation in networked devices. It also underscores the need for regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
