A vulnerability has been discovered in PrestaShop, an open-source e-commerce platform, that could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information through a JavaScript variable. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-26129, affects versions 8.1.0 and prior to 8.1.4, and has been classified as a medium severity issue.

The vulnerability arises from a path disclosure issue in a JavaScript variable, which could allow an attacker to access sensitive information such as file paths, directories, and other system information. This could potentially lead to a security breach or compromise of the system.

The vulnerability has been identified as CWE-22, which refers to the use of unsafe functions or APIs that can lead to path traversal attacks. The vulnerability has been discovered in the PrestaShop's JavaScript code, specifically in the way it handles file paths and directories.

To mitigate this vulnerability, PrestaShop has released a patch in version 8.1.4, which addresses the issue by properly sanitizing and encoding file paths and directories. It is recommended that users upgrade to version 8.1.4 or later to ensure their systems are secure.

In addition, security researchers have recommended implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and encoding, to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. It is also important to regularly review and audit code for security vulnerabilities to prevent attacks.

Overall, this vulnerability highlights the importance of secure coding practices and regular security audits to prevent security breaches and maintain the integrity of systems.
