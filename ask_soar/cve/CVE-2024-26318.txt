The vulnerability identified by the CVE ID CVE-2024-26318 affects Serenity versions before 6.8.0. It allows an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through an email link. The vulnerability exists because the LoginPage.tsx file permits return URLs that do not begin with a forward slash character. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email with a crafted link that, when clicked, executes a script in the user's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data theft.

The vulnerability was published on February 19, 2024, and has a "Received" status, indicating that the vulnerability has been received by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) but has not yet been analyzed or assigned a severity score. The affected software is Serenity, and the vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the LoginPage.tsx file.

The vulnerability has been identified in two languages, English and Spanish, and has been referenced in the Serenity release notes for version 6.8.0. There are no known mitigations or workarounds for this vulnerability, and users are advised to update to version 6.8.0 or later to address the issue.
