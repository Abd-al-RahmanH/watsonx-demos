The provided vulnerability data refers to CVE-2024-21892, which affects Linux systems running Node.js. The vulnerability allows unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the process's elevated privileges, potentially leading to a high impact security breach.

The vulnerability arises from a bug in the implementation of an exception to the rule that Node.js ignores certain environment variables set by unprivileged users. The exception allows CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to be set, but the bug incorrectly applies this exception even when other capabilities have been set.

The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5, with a base severity of HIGH and a base impact of HIGH. The attack vector is local, and the attack complexity is HIGH. The vulnerability requires low privileges to exploit and has a high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, and no availability impact.

The vulnerability was discovered by support@hackerone.com and was published on February 20, 2024. The reference URL provided is https://hackerone.com/reports/2237545.

In summary, CVE-2024-21892 is a high-impact vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to inject code with elevated privileges on Linux systems running Node.js. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 and requires a local attack with high attack complexity.
