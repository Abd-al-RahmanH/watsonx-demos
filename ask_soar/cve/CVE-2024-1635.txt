A vulnerability (CVE-2024-1635) has been identified in Undertow, a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. The vulnerability allows a malicious user to exhaust both memory and open file limits on the server by opening and closing a connection with the HTTP port and then immediately closing the connection. This can be achieved by exploiting a leak in the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit, which is not notified of the closed connection during the connection opening procedure. As a result, the worker thread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak.

The vulnerability has been rated as high severity with a base score of 7.5 and a base severity of HIGH. The attack vector is NETWORK, and the attack complexity is LOW. The vulnerability does not require any privileges or user interaction, and it does not impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system. However, it can lead to a high impact on the system's availability.

The vulnerability has been identified as CWE-400, and it has been referenced in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with the identifier CVE-2024-1635. Red Hat has released a security advisory and a patch to address the vulnerability. It is recommended to apply the patch to mitigate the vulnerability.
