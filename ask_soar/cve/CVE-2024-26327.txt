A vulnerability (CVE-2024-26327) has been identified in QEMU versions 7.1.0 through 8.2.1. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the VF implementations when a guest writes NumVFs greater than TotalVFs. This can be exploited by a malicious guest to potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.

The vulnerability is located in the register_vfs function in hw/pci/pcie_sriov.c and is caused by a mishandling of the situation where a guest writes NumVFs greater than TotalVFs. This leads to a buffer overflow in the VF implementations, which can be exploited by a malicious guest to potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.

The vulnerability was discovered on February 14, 2024, and was published on February 19, 2024. It has been identified as "Received" by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The vulnerability has been referenced in a Linux kernel mailing list post.

There are no known mitigations or workarounds for this vulnerability at this time. It is recommended to upgrade to a version of QEMU that is not affected by this vulnerability. Additionally, it is recommended to monitor for any suspicious activity on the host and to implement security measures to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability.
