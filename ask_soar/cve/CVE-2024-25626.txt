A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in the Yocto Project's Bitbake tool, specifically in the Toaster server component. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-25626, can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server's shell. The vulnerability is caused by missing input validation in the Toaster server, which can be triggered by a specifically crafted request.

The vulnerability affects Bitbake versions before 2.6.2, and has been fixed in version 2.6.2 and later. The fix has also been backported to version 5.0, 3.1.31, 4.0.16, and 4.3.2. It is important to note that the Toaster server is not enabled by default for Bitbake command line builds, and is only used for the Toaster web-based user interface to Bitbake.

The vulnerability has been rated as high severity, with a base score of 8.8 and a base severity of HIGH, according to the CVSS v3.1 metric. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, and no user interaction is required. The exploitability score is 2.8, and the impact score is 5.9.

The vulnerability is also associated with the CWE-78 weakness, which refers to the use of unsafe deserialization. The Yocto Project has released a security advisory, GHSA-75xw-78mm-72r4, which provides more information on the vulnerability and the fix.
