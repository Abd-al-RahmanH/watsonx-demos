A vulnerability in Mastodon, a free and open-source social network server, has been discovered and fixed in versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-25623, allows a threat actor to impersonate an account on a remote server that meets certain conditions. The vulnerability arises from Mastodon's failure to check for a Content-Type header value of the Activity Streams media type when fetching remote statuses. This allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Mastodon server fetch it, potentially leading to account impersonation.

The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation, specifically, the failure to check the Content-Type header value of the Activity Streams media type. This allows a threat actor to upload a malicious document that can be fetched by the Mastodon server, leading to account impersonation.

The vulnerability has been identified as CWE-434, which refers to the use of a weak or hard-coded credential. In this case, the hard-coded credential is the Activity Streams media type, which is not properly validated.

The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19 of Mastodon by properly validating the Content-Type header value. It is recommended that users upgrade to one of these versions to mitigate the vulnerability.

In addition, users should be cautious when accepting user-uploaded documents and ensure that proper input validation is in place to prevent similar vulnerabilities. It is also important to regularly review and update security measures to prevent potential attacks.
