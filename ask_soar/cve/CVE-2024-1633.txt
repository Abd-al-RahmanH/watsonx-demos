The vulnerability identified by CVE-2024-1633 affects the secure boot process in a specific software environment. During the boot process, the bl2 stage loops over images defined in the "bl2_mem_params_descs" table and reads the image length and destination from the image's certificate. However, the way the image length is read can result in an integer overflow, allowing an attacker to bypass memory range restrictions and write data out of buffer bounds. This could potentially bypass the secure boot mechanism and allow malicious code execution.

The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 2.0, indicating a low severity, and an exploitability score of 0.5, suggesting that exploitation is not straightforward. The affected software versions range from c2f286820471ed276c57e603762bd831873e5a17 until (not specified). The vulnerability is classified as CWE-190, indicating a buffer overflow or overrun.

The advisory provides a reference to the ASRG security advisory for more information and recommends updating to a version not affected by the vulnerability. There is no known exploit available for this vulnerability, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts are all considered low. However, the vulnerability can still be potentially dangerous, as it can allow an attacker to bypass the secure boot mechanism and execute malicious code. Therefore, it is recommended to apply the necessary updates to mitigate the vulnerability.
