The vulnerability (CVE-2024-1510) affects the WP Shortcodes Plugin - Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress, which is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes and tags. Authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers at Wordfence and has been identified as having a medium severity rating with a base score of 6.4 and a CVSS v3.1 vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N. The vulnerability has been confirmed to affect all versions of the plugin up to and including version 7.0.2.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has contributor-level or above permissions, which can be achieved through a variety of means, such as exploiting a separate vulnerability or tricking a site administrator into granting them access. Once an attacker has the required permissions, they can inject malicious code into the plugin's su_tooltip shortcode, which will be executed when a user accesses the page containing the injected code. The attacker can use this vulnerability to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, or to take control of the affected website.

The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers at Wordfence, who have provided a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, along with proof-of-concept code and mitigation recommendations. The researchers have also provided a list of affected versions of the plugin and have recommended that users update to version 7.0.3 or later to address the vulnerability. Additionally, the researchers have provided a reference to the Wordfence Threat Intelligence feed, which provides real-time updates on security vulnerabilities and threats.
