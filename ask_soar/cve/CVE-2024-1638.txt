A vulnerability has been identified in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack of Zephyr, a real-time operating system for microcontrollers, which could allow an attacker to read or write characteristics without proper authorization. The vulnerability is caused by a misconfiguration of permissions, where the BT_GATT_PERM_READ_LESC and BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_LESC defines are set without the necessary additional permissions, BT_GATT_PERM_READ_ENCRYPT/BT_GATT_PERM_READ_AUTHEN or BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_ENCRYPT/BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_AUTHEN. This allows an attacker to access the characteristics without the required encryption or authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.

The vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2024-1638 and has been rated as high severity with a base score of 8.2 and a base severity of HIGH. The attack vector is network-based, and the attack complexity is rated as LOW. No user interaction is required, and the vulnerability does not affect the availability of the system. The confidentiality impact is HIGH, as an attacker could potentially access sensitive data without authorization.

The vulnerability has been discovered by the Zephyr security team, and a patch has been released to address the issue. Users are advised to apply the patch as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of potential attacks. Additionally, the vulnerability has been linked to the CWE-20 weakness, which is a common weakness in software that can lead to unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information.
