A vulnerability (CVE-2023-6399) has been discovered in Zyxel ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.37 Patch 1, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.37 Patch 1, USG FLEX 50(W) series firmware versions 4.16 through 5.37 Patch 1, and USG20(W)-VPN series firmware versions 4.16 through 5.37 Patch 1. The vulnerability is a format string vulnerability that could allow an authenticated IPSec VPN user to cause DoS conditions against the “deviceid” daemon by sending a crafted hostname to an affected device if it has the “Device Insight” feature enabled. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.7, with a base severity of MEDIUM and an exploitability score of 2.1. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-134.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted hostname to the affected device, which will cause the “deviceid” daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition. The exploit requires low attack complexity and low privileges, and does not require user interaction. The vulnerability can be remotely exploited, and the impact is high, as it can cause a denial of service condition on the affected device.

The vulnerability was discovered by security@zyxel.com.tw, and a security advisory was published on February 20, 2024. The advisory provides instructions on how to mitigate the vulnerability, including disabling the “Device Insight” feature and upgrading to a firmware version that is not vulnerable to this issue.

It is important to note that this vulnerability can be exploited remotely, and could potentially be used to disrupt network services. Therefore, it is recommended to take immediate action to mitigate the vulnerability and prevent any potential attacks.
