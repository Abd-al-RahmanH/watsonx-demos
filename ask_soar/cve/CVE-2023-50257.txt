A vulnerability has been discovered in eProsima Fast DDS, a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard, which allows a malicious attacker to forcibly disconnect a Subscriber and deny a Subscriber attempting to connect. The vulnerability is caused by the lack of encryption for the data (`p[UD]`) and `guid` values used to disconnect between nodes, making it possible for an attacker to send a disconnection packet to the Global Data Space using the Publisher ID, disconnecting all Subscribers connected to the Publisher. The vulnerability has been present since the initial commit of the `SecurityManager.cpp` code in November 2016 and affects versions prior to 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. The vulnerability has been identified as CVE-2023-50257 and has a CVSS score of 9.6, indicating a critical severity.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a disconnection packet to the Global Data Space, which will disconnect all Subscribers connected to the Publisher. The attacker can also continuously send the disconnection packet to prevent Subscribers from reconnecting. The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the SROS2 patch, which encrypts the data (`p[UD]`) and `guid` values used to disconnect between nodes, making it impossible for an attacker to forcibly disconnect a Subscriber.

The vulnerability has been discovered by security researchers at GitHub and has been reported to eProsima. eProsima has acknowledged the vulnerability and has released patches for the affected versions. Users are advised to apply the patches as soon as possible to mitigate the vulnerability.
