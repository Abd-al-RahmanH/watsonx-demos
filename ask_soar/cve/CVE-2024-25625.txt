A vulnerability has been discovered in Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle, specifically in the `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController, which can be exploited by an attacker to perform phishing attacks. The host header from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs, and an attacker can manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint, resulting in the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain.

The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.1, with a base severity of HIGH, and an exploitability score of 1.7. The impact score is 5.8. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, and no user interaction is required. The vulnerability can lead to a high impact on confidentiality and integrity, and there is no impact on availability.

The vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to validate the host header, which is used to generate URLs. The maintainers recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.

The vulnerability has been identified as CWE-74, and it has been classified as a Primary weakness. The vulnerability has been discovered by security-advisories@github.com, and it has been patched in version 1.3.4 of the Pimcore Admin Classic Bundle. The patch is available on GitHub, and users are advised to update their installations as soon as possible.
